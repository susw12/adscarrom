To position the striker (the big white ball), move your mouse to the right or
left. To shoot, put your mouse in the center of the striker and drag in the
opposite direction of where you want to shoot. If you want to reposition the
striker while you are dragging, move the mouse back onto the striker and let go.
This is currently only a physics demonstration, so there are no rules. Try to
do some trick shots! If you catch any glitches in the physics, please tell us
